# bulgeadap_science
This is a repository of the scripts used to search GLIMPSE 1, 2, and 3D given the criteria
in Robitaille, et al. 2008. The sources in each version of GLIMPSE are compare to the 
sources found in the other versions to eliminate overlapping sources. The final list
of these sources goes in to query other infrared catalogs (such as DENIS, VVV, WISE, etc). 

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine
for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the 
project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
All you need to run this repo is python 2 or 3. I should change all of this to python3 to
be honest... 

## Running Tests
There are no tests defined yet

## Authors
Allyssa Riley -- Converted IDl to python and created some new scripts
Ben Sargent -- Initial work on glimpse3diro and glimpse3dirolist in IDL
